    Use a FIND query to retrieve active series after a timestamp for a given selector

    ACTIVEAFTER takes 4 parameters given as a list containing :
       - a read token
       - a class selector
       - labels as a map
       - Timestamp (in platform time unit, probably Âµs) after which a given Geo Time Series was active.

    Example : [ 'YourReadToken' 'class_selector' { } NOW 3 d - ] @ACTIVEAFTER
